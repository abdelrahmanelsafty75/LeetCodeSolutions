# LeetCodeDaily

Welcome to my daily LeetCode problem-solving repository! This repo documents my journey to improve algorithmic thinking and coding skills by solving one LeetCode problem daily. Solutions are written in **Python** and **Java**, with explanations and complexity analysis for each problem.

## Purpose
- Build a consistent habit of solving coding challenges.
- Strengthen problem-solving skills in algorithms and data structures.
- Create a portfolio to showcase my coding abilities for internships and job applications.
